## This mod is discontinued

The reason for that is that it is neat to develop something like that, but I'd prefer developing in versions like 1.16 and in the future
also 1.17 Of course, I could port this mod to 1.16, but that wouldn't really make sense, due to the main tools for automation Immersive
Railroading is in 1.12 If you want to continue this mod, go for it (would be nice to let me know, so I could link it)
Maybe I'll continue this mod in the future when Immersive Railroading is mainly on 1.16+, but until then, I won't continue this mod.

# Original README

This is mod was created for the use
with [Immersive Railroading](https://github.com/TeamOpenIndustry/ImmersiveRailroading "Immersive Railroading") and that's also the reason
it's for Minecraft 1.12.2 <br >
Keep in mind that this is and always will be a hobby project so I won't be able to completly focus on this mod.

# Feature List

Those are the things that I'd like to add. <br />

* Block related to rails (e.g. railbed)
* Signs
* Signals
* Grade Crossings
* OpenComputers / ComputerCraft intigration

# 1.16 Support

Minecraft 1.16 is not officially supported due to Immersive Railroading being buggy on there and many utility mods are also still on 1.12.2,
but once Immersive Railroading is sort of stable on 1.16 I'll probally port it. <br />
Once that would happen the 1.12 would be no longer supported. <br />
Although if you really want it on 1.16 your welcome to port it yourself.
