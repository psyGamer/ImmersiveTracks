# ImmersiveTracks

This is mod was created for the use with [Immersive Railroading](https://github.com/TeamOpenIndustry/ImmersiveRailroading "Immersive Railroading") and that's also the reason it's for Minecraft 1.12.2 <br >
Keep in mind that this is and always will be a hobby project so I won't be able to completly focus on this mod.

# Feature List

Those are the things that I'd like to add. <br />
Sadly I can't guarantie that any of those will actually get added, tho I'm definetly trying it.

# 1.16 Support

Minecraft 1.16 is not officially supported due to Immersive Railroading being buggy on there and many utility mods are also still on 1.12.2, but once Immersive Railroading is sort of stable on 1.16 I'll probally port it. <br />
Once that would happen the 1.12 would be no longer supported. <br />
Although if you really want it on 1.16 your welcome to port it yourself.
